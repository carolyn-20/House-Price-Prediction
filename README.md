# House-Price-Prediction
This repository contains a House Price Prediction model that leverages machine learning techniques to estimate property prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and more. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using regression algorithms.

Features:

Data preprocessing and cleaning
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Multiple regression models 
Model evaluation 
Interactive visualization of price predictions
ðŸ“Œ Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

ðŸ”— Dataset: Publicly available or custom dataset for training and testing

Feel free to explore, contribute, and improve the model! ðŸš€
